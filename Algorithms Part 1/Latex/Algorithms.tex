\section{Course Introduction}
Algorithm is a method for solving a problem and data structure is method to store information.
 We study algorithm to solve problem that could not otherwise be addressed. We also study 
 algorithms for intellectual stimulation.
 
 \begin{center}
     Algorithms + Data Structure = Programs
 \end{center}
 Algorithms may unlock the secrets of life and of the universe.


\section{Union Find}
\subsection{Dinamic Connectivity problem}
On a given set of N objects, design a algorithms to perform the following operations.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Union command : This command will connect two objects in the given set.
    \item Find/connected query : Is there a path connecting the two objects?
\end{itemize}
